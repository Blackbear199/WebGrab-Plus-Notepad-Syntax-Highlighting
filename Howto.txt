WG++SiteIni.xml is a User Defined Language (UDL) file. This file can be imported into Notepad++, to make Notepad++ highlight special WebGrab++ names.

Howto:
1. open Notepad++
2. click Language>Define your language...
3. click Import
4. select the WG++SiteIni.xml file and click Open
5. Notepad++ should say "Import Successful."
6. restart Notepad++
7. open a WebGrab++ ini file
8. click Language>WG++SiteIni
9. the siteini file should now be syntax highlighted


Remarks:
There are still some issues with this file.
Currently these issue(s) can't be fixed, because of the limitation that the UDL currently has.

Issue(s):
- if there are ' inside scrub strings, the syntax highlighting can be chaos from that point on. Mostly only the current line is affected
